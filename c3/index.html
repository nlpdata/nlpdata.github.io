                                        <p>1928年，经徐志摩介绍，时任中国公学校长的胡适聘用了沈从文做讲师，主讲大学一年级的现代文学选修课。</p>
                                        <p>当时，沈从文已经在文坛上崭露头角，在社会上也小有名气，因此还未到上课时间，教室里就坐满了学生。上课时间到了，沈从文走进教室，看见下面黑压压一片，心里陡然一惊，脑子里变得一片空白，连准备了无数遍的第一句话都堵在嗓子里说不出来了。</p>
                                        <p>他呆呆地站在那里，面色尴尬至极，双手拧来拧去无处可放。上课前他自以为成竹在胸，所以就没带教案和教材。整整10分钟，教室里鸦雀无声，所有的学生都好奇地等着这位新来的老师开口。沈从文深吸了一口气，慢慢平静了下来，原先准备好的东西也重新在脑子里聚拢，然后他开始讲课了。不过由于他依然很紧张，原本预计一小时的授课内容，竟然用了不到15分钟就讲完了。</p>
                                        <p>接下来怎么办？他再次陷入了窘境。无奈之下，他只好拿起粉笔在黑板上写道：我第一次上课，见你们人多，怕了。</p>
                                        <p>顿时，教室里爆发出了一阵善意的笑声，随即一阵鼓励的掌声响起。得知这件事之后，胡适对沈从文大加赞赏，认为他非常成功。</p>
                                        <p>有了这次经历，在以后的课堂上，沈从文都会告诫自己不要紧张，渐渐地，他开始在课堂上变得从容起来。</p>

                                        <p>In 1928, recommended by Hsu Chih-Mo, Hu Shih, who was the president of the previous National University of China, employed Shen Ts’ung-wen as a lecturer of the university who was in charge of teaching the optional course of modern literature.</p>
                                        <p>At that time, Shen already made himself conspicuous in the literary world and was a little famous in society. For this sake, even before the beginning of class, the classroom was crowded with students. Upon the arrival of class, Shen went into the classroom. Seeing a dense crowd of students sitting beneath the platform, Shen was suddenly startled and his mind went blank. He was even unable to utter the first sentence he had rehearsed repeatedly.</p>
                                        <p>He stood there motionlessly, extremely embarrassed. He wrung his hands without knowing where to put them. Before class, he believed that he had had a ready plan to meet the situation so he did not bring his teaching plan and textbook. For up to 10 minutes, the classroom was in perfect silence. All the students were curiously waiting for the new teacher to open his mouth. Breathing deeply, he gradually calmed down. Thereupon, the materials he had previously prepared gathered in his mind for the second time. Then he began his lecture. Nevertheless, since he was still nervous, it took him less than 15 minutes to finish the teaching contents he had planned to complete in an hour.</p>
                                        <p>What should he do next? He was again caught in embarrassment. He had no choice but to pick up a piece of chalk before writing several words on the blackboard: This is the first time I have given a lecture. In the presence of a crowd of people, I feel terrified.</p>
                                        <p>Immediately, a peal of friendly laughter filled the classroom. Presently, a round of encouraging applause was given to him. Hearing this episode, Hu heaped praise upon Shen, thinking that he was very successful.</p>
                                        <p>Because of this experience, Shen always reminded himself of not being nervous in his class for years afterwards. Gradually, he began to give his lecture at leisure in class.</p>
